# Graveyard

The **graveyard** is a subforum for [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap) that have been abandoned by their creator(s). Graveyarded maps do not count towards a user's total upload limit. The [beatmap host](/wiki/Beatmap/Beatmap_host) may "revive" a beatmap by updating it. This requires a free pending slot and sends it back to being a [Work in Progress](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#work-in-progress-and-pending) beatmap.

Beatmaps that are not updated by their creator for **28 days** will automatically be sent to the Graveyard.
